## Introduction

This is the github repositor of GitHub Classroom IIT-Bombay-SoC2024-Project-ID24 for the Seasons of Code 2024 Project ID 24, scam'92_v2.0, which uses State of the Art Machine Learning models for price prediction.

## Timeline

The project is roughly spread across 8 weeks time period.
The initial 4 weeks deal with the foundation of Machine Learning and also implementation of LSTMs in the fourth week. In the last 4 weeks, we will pick up a bit more pace and we will be delving into the GenAI side and using GANs and GRUs for price prediction. I would recommend the candiates to complete their initial 4 weeks as early as possible so they can move to the GenAI part and complete the project on time.

### Week 1 and Week 1.5

Since, most of the mentees do not have a background in Machine Learning, it is recommended to do acquire some knowledge on the subject. Keeping in mind, the time constraints, it is recommended to refer to online courses and lectures, so that you can have a general of Machine Learning, related libraries.

### Week 1.5 to Week 3

Now that everyone is confident in Machine Learning, the next ideal step

## FAQs

### The coursera courses are paid / can't be accessed by IITB account

1. Yes, the coursera courses are paid and can't be accessed by IIT Bombay account. You can choose to pay for the course or You can apply for fee waiver at the time of registration. You can also audit the course (you will be doing the course without any certificate).

2. If all these still don't work out for you, you can check the alternative courses and materials provided. Moreover, you can find the code of the labs from coursera courses from github.com, by searching on google.com as site:github.com <course_name> coursera lab codes.
